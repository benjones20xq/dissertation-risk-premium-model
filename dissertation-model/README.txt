# Dissertation model (Financial Data Science MSc)

This repository contains some example code from my MSc dissertation (Distinction).  
It implements a stochastic/financial modelling workflow using public market data.

## What's included
- Core scripts in `src/`
- Outputs/plots will be saved to `outputs/` (once packaged)

## Notes
This is an initial upload. I will tidy structure, add a quickstart entry point, and document dependencies.
